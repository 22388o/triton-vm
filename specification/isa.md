# Triton VM Instruction Set Architecture

Triton VM is a stack machine with RAM, with a second data structure for evaluating a sponge permutation.
The arithmetization of the VM is defined over the *B-field* $\mathbb{F}_p$ where $p=2^{64}-2^{32}+1$.
This means the registers and memory elements take values from $\mathbb{F}_p$, and the transition function gives rise to low-degree transition verification polynomials from the ring of multivariate polynomials over $\mathbb{F}_p$.

## Data Structures

**Memory**
The term *memory* refers to a data structure that gives read access (and possibly write access, too) to elements indicated by an *address*.
The address lives in the same field.
There are four separate notions of memory:
1. *RAM*, to which the VM can read and write field elements.
2. *Program Memory*, from which the VM reads instructions.
3. *OpStack Memory*, which stores the part of the operational stack that is not represented explicitly by the operational stack registers.
4. *Jump Stack Memory*, which stores the entire jump stack.

**OpStack**
The stack is a last-in;first-out data structure that allows the program to store intermediate variables, pass arguments, and keep pointers to objects held in RAM.

**Jump Stack**
Another last-in;first-out data structure that keeps track of return and destination addresses.
This stack changes only when control follows a `call` or `return` instruction.

## Registers

This section covers all columns in the Protocol Table.
Only a subset of these registers relate to the instruction set;
the remaining registers exist only to enable an efficient arithmetization and are marked with an asterisk.

**Instruction**
The instruction is represented by one register called the *current instruction register* `ci`.
This value then decomposed into its 6 constituent bits, giving rise to 6 *instruction bit registers*, labeled `ib0` through `ib5`.
Additionally, there is a register called the *instruction pointer* (`ip`), which contains the address of the current instruction in instruction memory.
Also, there is the *next instruction register* `ni` that contains the next instruction.
For immediate instructions, `ni` takes the value of the next instruction.
Otherwise, `ni` holds the argument for current instruction `ci`.

**Stack**
The stack is represented by ?-many registers called *stack registers* (`st0` â€“ `st?`), which take the values of the top ?-many stack elements.
In addition to these registers, there is the *operational stack pointer* register `osp` whose value is the length of the operational stack minus ?.
The stack grows upwards, in line with the metaphor that justifies the name "stack".

**RAM**

**Helper Variables**
Some instructions require helper variables in order to generate an efficient arithmetization.
To this end, there are 5 helper registers, labeled `hv0` through `hv4`.
These registers are part of the arithmetization of the architecture, but not needed to define the instruction set.
